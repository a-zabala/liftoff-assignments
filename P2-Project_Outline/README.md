## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Pandemi will allow people to record their experiences during the pandemic.  Families in particular will be able to create an account and record their memories, accomplishments and goals.  Within a family account, each family member can have a profile to keep a diary, track their goals, and record their accomplishments.  Users can add pictures and links to help them keep their memories and access information to use later.  

I came up with this idea while trying to navigate the new shelter in place world with my children.  While documneting our experiences in pictures, I realized it would be great to memorialize the experiences we were having, to either help us focus on the positives, or look back to a historically significant time we lived through.
